    "ANGLE" – angle of amino-acids step.
    Set it in radians. Use numpy «pi»
    By default angle is 5pi/9 (100 degrees)

    "NODES_IN_WHEEL" — integer number.
    How many times acid can fit in projection.
    By default - 18.

    "BEGIN_POSITION" — position of first amino-acid.
    By default - pi/2
